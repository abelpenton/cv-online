      Beyond coding, I'm passionate about fitness, boxing, martial arts, and running, which help me stay active and focused.
      I also enjoy playing video games as a way to unwind and explore creative storytelling.

      One of my favorite ways to connect with friends is by cooking <strong>asados</strong>, a tradition that combines great food and meaningful moments.
